You need to have these installed to play functioanlly most likely.

noto-fonts-emoji //for the background itself

pulseaudio //to play the audio files

I will upload a no audio version for those who dont want to install pulseaudio


For Arch Linux

  sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-emoji

  sudo pacman -S pulseaudio


For Ubuntu

  sudo apt install noto-fonts-emoji

  sudo apt install -S pulseaudio


If you need it on other distros, you probably know how to install it yourself.


To play the game.

go into a terminal, and type ./snake.exe

or if you want, some of you can right click and open in terminal, it depends on your file browser.


That should be all.
